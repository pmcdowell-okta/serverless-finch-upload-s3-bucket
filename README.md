# serverless-finch-upload-s3-bucket
Simple example of how to upload files to S3 bucket using Serverless Framework and Finch

I had a hard time finding an example that worked.

### Prerequisites

you need to install server-finch, it's easy:

` npm install --save serverless-finch`

If you create your S3 bucket this command should work for you:

`serverless client deploy --region us-east-1`
